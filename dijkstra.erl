% function helps us iterate through all nodes in the map/list to find the length of the path to a specific node calling the function
entry(Node, []) ->
    % empty list or not found node returns 0

entry(Node, [{Node, Length, _Gateway} | _Rest]) ->
    % If the current node in the tuple matches the Node we are looking for, it returns the Length (the path length to that node).

    % If the current element in the list doesnâ€™t match the Node, the function recursively calls itself with the Rest of the list.

replace(Node, N, Gateway, Nodes) ->
    % takes the new tuple for Node and inserts to the list Nodes, and deletes the previous tuple connected to this Node from the list, and calls the insert function to sort the list correctly

insert(New, [Node | Rest]) ->
    % when the new node is not added to the list since it has a longer length than the node it is being checked against in the list, it will iterate through the nodes in the list
